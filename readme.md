# Mini Projects

This repository consists of small projects that I have made with python as well as some code practices/exercises I may have done from online resources.

The code in here may not be very clean and perfect, and also may not follow conventions as I was self-taught. Hopefully, I'll be able to pick up good practices.

This repository will be updated when there are changes done to a past mini project or ongoing development with a new project.

Note that the code here may be reused but I doubt anyone would want to use it as my code isn't the most efficient
